Project Overview
This project aims to detect duplicate question pairs in the Quora dataset. By identifying similar questions, the system can help streamline the question-answering process and improve the efficiency of information retrieval on the platform.

Key Features:
Data Exploration: Load and explore the Quora dataset to understand its structure and characteristics.
Text Preprocessing: Implement various techniques to clean and preprocess the text data, including the removal of HTML tags and special characters.
Feature Engineering: Extract meaningful features from the text data to improve the modelâ€™s ability to detect duplicate questions.
Modeling: Apply machine learning models such as Random Forest and XGBoost, as well as deep learning models like LSTM and BiLSTM, to predict duplicate question pairs.
Evaluation: Assess model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall.
Technologies Used:
Python: Core language for data processing and modeling.
Pandas: For handling and manipulating data structures.
Numpy: For numerical operations and array management.
Seaborn & Matplotlib: For data visualization and analysis.
BeautifulSoup: For text cleaning and preprocessing.
